## Description

Navigating the mysteries of AI 'black boxes' can be challenging. However, my thesis introduces an innovative approach that increases model explainability and surpasses traditional accuracy levels. We focus on classifying rice and raisin types using computer vision techniques on grayscale images to extract essential attributes. These attributes feed into a 7-input, 2-output Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), further optimized using a Genetic Algorithm. The result is a transparent, highly effective classification system that outperforms standard machine learning models in both accuracy and explainability. Our method unlocks the AI 'black box', demonstrating the potential of fuzzy systems and genetic algorithms in advanced AI applications.

The model outperforms by 95% and 87% in Rice and Raisin data sets.
